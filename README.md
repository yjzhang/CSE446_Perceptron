CSE446 17SP HW3
===============

First get the assignment by running:
    
    git clone https://github.com/yjzhang/CSE446_Perceptron.git
    cd CSE446_Perceptron

You will be modifying the file `perceptron.py`.

In this problem, we seek to perform a digit recognition task, where we are given an image of a handwritten digit and wish to predict what number it represents. This is a special case of an important area of language processing known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). We will be simplifying our goal to that of a binary classification between two relatively hard-to-distinguish numbers (specifically, predicting a '3' versus a '5'). To do this, you will implement a kernelized version of the Perceptron algorithm.

### Data

The digit images have been taken from the Kaggle competition linked to on the projects page, \url{http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data}. This data was originally from the MNIST database of handwritten digits, but was converted into a easier-to-use file format.

The data has also undergone some preprocessing. It has been filtered to just those datapoints whose labels are 3 or 5, which have then been relabeled to 1 and -1 respectively. Then, 1000-point samples have been created, named \emph{validation.csv} and \emph{test.csv}. The first column of these files is the label of each point, followed by the grayscale value of each pixel.


### Perceptron [40 points]

First, get the Perceptron working with the kernel $k_p^1(u,v) = u \cdot v + 1$.

Implement the function `dot_kf`, and implement the methods for `Perceptron`.

Run Perceptron for a single pass over the validation set with this kernel, and plot the average loss as a function of the number of steps. Record the average loss every 100 steps, e.g. [100, 200, 300, ...]. The loss is the number of times the perceptron classified incorrectly divided by the total number of points classified so far.

Run the perceptron in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the bottom of the code.

### Polynomial kernel [30 points]

Implement the function `poly_kernel`.

For the set `d = [1,3,5,7,10,15,20]`, run Perceptron for a single pass over the validation set with `poly_kernel(d)`, and plot the average loss over the entire validation set as a function of `d`. What value of `d` produces the lowest loss?

### Exponential kernel [30 points]

Implement the function `exp_kernel`.

For the `d` you chose in the previous step, run Perceptron with both `poly_kernel(d)` and `exp_kernel(10)` for a single pass over the testing set. For each of these two kernels, plot the average loss as a function of the number of steps. As above, report the average loss for every 100 steps.

### Submitting

You will need to submit at least two files: `perceptron.py`, and a PDF file containing all of the plots.
